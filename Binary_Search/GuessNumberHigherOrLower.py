# Guess Number Higher or Lower - https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/
'''We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns 3 possible results:

-1: The number I picked is lower than your guess (i.e. pick < num).
1: The number I picked is higher than your guess (i.e. pick > num).
0: The number I picked is equal to your guess (i.e. pick == num).
Return the number that I picked.

Example 1:

Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
Example 2:

Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1'''

# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0

        while low < high:
            mid = low + (high-low) // 2
            pickedNumber = guess(mid)
            if pickedNumber == 0:
                return mid
            elif pickedNumber == 1:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low
