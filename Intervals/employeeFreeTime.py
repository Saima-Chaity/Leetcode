# Employee Free Time - https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-free-time/
'''We are given a list schedule of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.
Each employee has a list of non-overlapping Intervals, and these intervals are in sorted order.
Return the list of finite intervals representing common, positive-length free time for all employees, also in sorted order.
(Even though we are representing Intervals in the form [x, y], the objects inside are Intervals, not lists or arrays. 
For example, schedule[0][0].start = 1, schedule[0][0].end = 2, and schedule[0][0][0] is not defined).  
Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.

Example 1:

Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
Output: [[3,4]]
Explanation: There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.'''
