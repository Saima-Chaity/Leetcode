# Array Manipulation
# Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each operation add a value to each of the array 
# element between two given indices, inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum value in the array.

# Example

# Queries are interpreted as follows:

#     a b k
#     1 5 3
#     4 8 7
#     6 9 1
# Add the values of  between the indices  and  inclusive:

# index->	 1 2 3  4  5 6 7 8 9 10
# 	[0,0,0, 0, 0,0,0,0,0, 0]
# 	[3,3,3, 3, 3,0,0,0,0, 0]
# 	[3,3,3,10,10,7,7,7,0, 0]
# 	[3,3,3,10,10,8,8,8,1, 0]
# The largest value is  after all operations are performed.
