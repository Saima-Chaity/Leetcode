# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree - https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/
'''Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in
T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.'''

'''Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III 
https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-iii/

Given two nodes of a binary tree p and q, return their lowest common ancestor (LCA).

Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for Node is below:

class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
}
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a tree T 
is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
