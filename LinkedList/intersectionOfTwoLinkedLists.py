# Intersection of Two Linked Lists - https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/
'''Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
