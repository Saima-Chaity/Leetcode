# Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree - https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-list-to-binary-search-tree/
'''Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two
subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:

Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5'''


# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def sortedListToBST(self, head: ListNode) -> TreeNode:

        def findMid(head):
            slow = head
            fast = head
            prev = None

            while fast and fast.next:
                prev = slow
                slow = slow.next
                fast = fast.next.next
            if prev:
                prev.next = None
            return slow

        if not head:
            return None
        mid = findMid(head)
        node = TreeNode(mid.val)
        if head == mid:
            return node
        node.left = self.sortedListToBST(head)
        node.right = self.sortedListToBST(mid.next)
        return node
